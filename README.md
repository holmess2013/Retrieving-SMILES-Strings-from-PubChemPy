# Retrieving-SMILES-Strings-from-PubChemPy
In this project, I curate a small dataset of ligands for the estrogen receptor and retrieve their SMILES strings from the PubChem database using the PubChemPy library. I have two notebooks, the first where I scan through a serious of compound tables I have pulled from the article "The Estrogen Receptor Relative Binding Affinities of 188 Natural and Xenochemicals: Structural Diversity of Ligands" - Blair et al. 2000. I then search the PubChem database by chemical name and retrieve the SMILES string. In the second notebook, I use the SMILES string to obtain the morgan fingerprint using the RDKit library.
